### ***Description***

This project includes exercises and homeworks from the lecture 
Open-Source Energy System Modeling by Daniel Hubmann. 

In this project you can calculate Resistance / Capacitor - Circuits. 

You can calculate serial / parallel impedance of R and C. 
Further you can calculate the power S, Q, P with a given voltage U.
